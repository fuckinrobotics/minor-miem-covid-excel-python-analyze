This is repository for minor course "Methods of intelligent information processing in medicine" at MIEM HSE UNIVERSITY. 

## Tasks
1. Based on the normalized data on the daily number of infected people, 
find an estimate of the average number of descendants of a single particle for
a branching process describing the epidemic process.
Is this process subcritical, critical, or supercritical?

2. Find an estimate of the probability of the absence of descendants of one particle under the
assumption that the number of descendants of one particle has
a geometric distribution.

3. Find the probability of degeneration of the branching process
describing the epidemic process, assuming that the number
of descendants of one particle has a geometric distribution.

4. If the process is subcritical, find the approximate average
time until the process degenerates (end of the epidemic).

5. Model 5 trajectories of the branching process in
the interval from 1 to 30 days of observations, build the corresponding
graphs. Average the values of the generated trajectories for
each day of observations(from 1 to 30), plot the average
trajectory and compare it with real data.
